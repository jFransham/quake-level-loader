BACKGROUND

STORY:

Trespass is set in an old ammonia Factory in Germany that was abandoned after WW2. The place deteriorated in peace for many years until one day when Sarge and Keel rediscovered it on a weekend urban exploration trip. They transformed it into an illegal dueling arena which is now notorious for attracting the shadiest, most degenerate Quake duelers and aggressive play. Be advised: trespassers will be shot on sight!

GAMEPLAY:

I got a flash of inspiration to make this layout after watching Quantic Dream's short film "Kara". The map was actually codenamed "Kara" during the alpha testing phase. Gameplay-wise, I was thinking about Lost World, Toxicity, and Blood Run, in that order for inspiration. My goals were to improve on making interesting connections between 3-4 rooms and to create trick jumps by making lots of small changes in elevation. I also tried to incorporate more cover than in my previous maps. This map is primarily designed for duel mode, but FFA has an alternative item layout and works well with three or four players.

ART:

I was inspired to do an abandoned factory theme after seeing Helder Pinto's amazing "Post Apocalyptic" UDK scene. I realized the the theme could work really well for a Q3A level because the detail wouldn't interfere with player movement. I spent a lot of time on www.dubtown.de checking out abandoned factories in Germany from the WW2 era. I fell in love with an album of an old ammonia factory (http://www.dubtown.de/photogallery/photos/fabrik_safea.html) and that served as the main concept art for the map. The central pillar by the RA is modeled after an old high-pressure ammonia reactor.

I'd like to give special thanks to the awesome artists who contributed assets to this map. Without them, this map would never have been made. First and foremost I have to mention Hipshot (www.zfight.com) who created all the trees and FX for this map, as well as the sky. I am also borrowing most of the textures from his map Rustgrad. Sock (www.simonoc.com) created all the plants and the seams/shapes that I applied to many of the metal textures. Some of the metal textures are by Phantazm11 (www.phantazm11.com) from his map Solarium. I've also used decals by Tabun (www.tabun.nl). I made the rest of the textures using photo sources (www.cgtextures.com). Note that I have heavily edited a lot of the assets I borrowed from other artists.
